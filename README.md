## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is mostly going to be populated with stuff I made in uni, so I only make public what I believe isnt made with really stinky code, that's why it's kind of empty.

# [Python The Game](https://github.com/giovanisims/Python-The-Game)

##### This was made as a final project for CS50P 2024

This is recreation of the Snake game in python it's got wrap-around edges, relatively random placements for the pieces of meat which has sound effects when eaten and some AI generated Lo-Fi music 

# [Batuta](https://batuta.pro)

This is a website made with Kadence WP for a PHD dissertation, it contains guidelines for the test that the dissertation revolved around, it also has some useful/interesting information about sound and auditory health.
